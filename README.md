# SeCon Competition 2019-2020

This repository contains all software related to Mississippi State University's SeCon Robotics Team for the [2020 IEEE Southeast Conference Hardware Competition][Competition Page]. The competition's GitHub can be found [here][Competition GitHub].

### Robots
The team is building two robots in parallel, **Robot230** and **PointyShark**. Each robot has a dedicated member that manages the hardware design, construction, and behaviors of the robot.

## Robot230
Managed by Sam Madden
![Robot picture coming soon][Robot230 Picture]

A robot built to push arcade buttons using the **hockeystick method** (_use of an L shaped arm on a servo_) at each of the ten buttons. Its method of expanding to all the buttons is the **Dorito method** (_use of two solid side platforms that swing out_).

## PointyShark
Managed by Oakley Edington
